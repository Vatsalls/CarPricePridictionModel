PROJECT TITLE:
Used Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars using a machine learning regression approach. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed using Python libraries. Categorical variables were encoded, numerical features were scaled, and exploratory data analysis was performed through visualizations. A Random Forest Regressor model was trained and evaluated to generate accurate price predictions.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

KEY STEPS IMPLEMENTED:

Data cleaning and duplicate removal

Encoding categorical features using LabelEncoder

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training using Random Forest Regressor

Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score

Feature importance analysis

PROJECT TYPE:
Machine Learning / Data Analytics

PURPOSE:
To demonstrate practical application of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation for solving real-world price prediction problems.
